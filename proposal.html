            <section>
                <p>Under the influence of COVID-19, the market price for everyday goods skyrocketed. The level of stress
                    similarly increased as an increasing number of individuals now fail to financially support
                    themselves. Pets, in a crisis time like now, are subject to abandonment and underfeeding. Animal
                    shelters are now facing a dilemma as the number of stray animals has almost reached the maximum
                    capacity. Limited resources have made it extremely difficult for shelters to operate normally and
                    continue to take in new stray animals. According to the <a
                        href="https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics"
                        target="_blank">ASPCA</a>, approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized
                    each year. The good thing is that many people are willing to help out these animals in need even
                    though they are not able to adopt them at the moment due to the lack of living space or time.</p>
                <p>Although many animal shelters and rescues have websites and they take donations there, people
                    sometimes are reluctant to donate money online because of concern for charity fraud. They want to
                    ensure the money is used for the benefit of the animals, but shelters do not usually give updates on
                    pets to donors. Donors get a thank-you email for their donation which is not enough to keep people
                    motivated in the long term. We want to help the shelter to feed animals and build bonds between
                    animal loving people and the animals they are helping.</p>

                We are creating a website to provide a fund-raising platform to achieve long-distanced pet feeding
                services. By creating this website, we are exploring the problem of what information problems related to
                pet feeding services are unaddressed.
                In addition, while designing the app, we have kept in mind what are the other apps with the same
                intention and what are their strength and weakness. Our overall goal is to attract more funding for the
                animal shelters to help alleviate the underfunding situation in animal shelters and achieve
                better resource allocation.
                For rescue staff, they can create new pet profiles and upload photos of the pet once a week so donors
                can ensure the pets are getting taken care of.
                By doing so, rescue animals will be well fed while waiting for their pawrents and donors can have a more
                intimate relationship with the pet.
                We want to make an application to feed animals in the rescues. People who want pets but can not afford owning one themselves can donate money to feed a pet of their choice. They can view the pet profile and choose the number of meals they wish to feed the pet. We will get the data from various rescues and adoption websites such as <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/developers/ ">Petfinder</a>.
