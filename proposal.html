                <section>
                    <p>Under the influence of COVID-19, the market price for everyday goods skyrocketed. The level of stress similarly increased as an increasing number of individuals now fail to financially support themselves. Pets, in a crisis time like now, are subject to abandonment and underfeeding. Animal shelters are now facing a dilemma as the number of stray animals has almost reached the maximum capacity. Limited resources have made it extremely difficult for shelters to operate normally and continue to take in new stray animals. <a href="https://www.aspca.org/helping-people-pets/shelter-intake-and-surrender/pet-statistics" target="_blank">According to the ASPCA</a>, approximately 920,000 shelter animals are euthanized each year. The good thing is that many people are willing to help out these animals in need even though they are not able to adopt them at the moment due to the lack of living space or time.</p>
                    <p>Although many animal shelters and rescues have websites and they take donations there, people sometimes are reluctant to donate money online because of concern for charity fraud. They want to ensure the money is used for the benefit of the animals, but shelters do not usually give updates on pets to donors. Donors get a thank-you email for their donation which is not enough to keep people motivated in the long term. We want to help the shelter to feed animals and build bonds between animal loving people and the animals they are helping.</p>

                    We are creating a website to provide a fund-raising platform to achieve long-distanced pet feeding services. By creating this website, we are exploring the problem of what information problems related to pet feeding services are unaddressed. 
                    In addition, while designing the app, we have kept in mind what are the other apps with the same intention and what are their strength and weakness. Our overall goal is to attract more funding for the animal shelters to help alleviate the underfunding situation in animal shelters and achieve
                    better resource allocation.
